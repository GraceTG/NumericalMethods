### General Description 
LU Factorization uses Gauss Elimation to create the upper and lower triangular matrices for linear systems. This is done with partial pivoting. 
### Code Despcription 
The square matrix A must be inputed initially and the pivoting matrix is set to the identity matrix of that. Rows are then pivoted and elements are eliminated until they are simplified down to to the upper and lower triangular matrices which are outputed.
