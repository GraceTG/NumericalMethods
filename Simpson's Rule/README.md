This algorithm uses Simpson's 1/3 Rule to estimate the value of an intergral of a functon. Simpson's is exact for estimation of cubic functions. It uses three points and their function values, two are inputed and the third is their midpoint. In this algorithm, for odd inputs the Trapezoid Rule will be used for the last interval since Simpson's 1/3 can only be used for even inputs.
