### General Description 
Simpson's 1/3 Rule is used to estimate the value of an intergral of a functon. Simpson's is exact for estimation of cubic functions. It uses three points and their function values, two are inputed and the third is their midpoint.  
### Code Description 
In this algorithm, for odd inputs the Trapezoid Rule will be used for the last interval since Simpson's 1/3 can only be used for even inputs. Points and their function values are inputed and based on their even or odd total, either simpsons 1/3 or a combination of simpsons and the trapezoid rule for the last interval will be used.
